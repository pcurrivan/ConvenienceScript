Convenience Script Mod for Baldur's Gate: EE games

This script provides basic attack functionality as well as hotkeys to activate some special convenience features. The convenience features can only be activated out of combat.  

Characters with stealth ability will automatically attempt to hide when out of combat.  

Bards will automatically sing their battlesong and attack.  

Attack Functionality:  
Warriors will approach enemies and attack. Non-warriors will attack enemies within weapon range but will not approach distant enemies. Characters will not stop detecting traps, singing a bardsong, or turning undead to attack, but they will break invisibility or stealth. To keep a character in stealth, toggle off AI.  

Hotkeys (affecting selected characters):  
"K" - Opens a store, allowing you to sell items immediately without trekking back to town. The store has no price depreciation.  
"B" - Gives instant casting with no recovery for 6 seconds, for your prebuffing convenience.  
"N" - Recover spent spells and abilities.  
"Y" - Equip a melee weapon  
"U" - Equip a ranged weapon  

Note that Y and U are bound by default to toggling some UI elements.  It is recommended that you unbind these default actions.  

Spell Hotkeys:
Instantly casts the spell without using a spell slot.  The character must know the spell.  
"S" - Minor Sequencer  
"D" - Spell Sequencer  
"E" - Spell Trigger  
"C" - Contingency  
"V" - Chain Contingency  
"T" - Melf's Minute Meteors  
"G" - Stoneskin / Ironskin  
"F" - Friends
