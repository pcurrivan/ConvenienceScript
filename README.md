# ConvenienceScript
Convenience Script Mod for Baldur's Gate: EE games

This script provides basic attack functionality as well as hotkeys to activate some special convenience features. The convenience features can only be activated out of combat.  

Characters with stealth ability will automatically attempt to hide when out of combat.  

Bards will automatically sing their battlesong and attack.  

Attack Functionality:  
Warriors will approach enemies and attack. Non-warriors will attack enemies within weapon range but will not approach distant enemies. Characters will not stop detecting traps, singing a bardsong, or turning undead to attack, but they will break invisibility or stealth. To keep a character in stealth, toggle off AI.  

Hotkeys (affecting selected characters):  
"K" - Opens a store, allowing you to sell items immediately without trekking back to town. The store has no price depreciation.
"B" - Gives instant casting with no recovery for 6 seconds, for your prebuffing convenience.
"N" - Recover spent spells and abilities.  

Mage Hotkeys (You must be capable of casting the spell):  
"S" - Minor Sequencer  
"D" - Spell Sequencer  
"C" - Contingency  
"V" - Chain Contingency  
"T" - Melf's Minute Meteors  
"G" - Stoneskin  
"F" - Friends
